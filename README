This is my library to load the results of the Bouguet calibration toolbox
(http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/). All you need to run this
code is Numpy, Scipy and the Python bindings that come with recent versions
of OpenCV (cv2.Rodrigues must exist).

Once you have run the bouguet toolkit and got a calibration you want, save
and you should have the files 'Calib_Results.m', 'Calib_Results.mat' and 'calib_data.mat'.

Calib_Results.mat is the one to open - this library produces Intrinsics and Extrinsics
objects containing the data converted from Matlab and in a far more readable format
(ie no variable names like 'kc').

Example:


>>> from calib_bouguet import load_calib_results
>>> results = load_calib_results('/some/path/to/Calib_Results.mat')
>>> print results.intrinsics.matrix
[[ 569.49071207    0.          328.55352627]
 [   0.          565.09086614  245.12172306]
 [   0.            0.            1.        ]]

Many thanks to Jean-Yves Bouguet (jbouguet at gmail dot com) for putting together
the original toolbox.
